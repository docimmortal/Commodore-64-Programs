MATCH-EM
========
Match-Em is a very simple basic game from my upcoming book called  "Intro 
To Commodore 64 Basic". I'm hoping to finish the book by late summer 2026.

The program includes the following concepts: two-dimensional arrays, random
numbers, and getting input from keyboard.

If you want to make changes, you can easily save your updated version
by executing:

run 1

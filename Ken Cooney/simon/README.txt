SIMON
=====
Simon is a very simple basic game from my upcoming book called  "Intro 
To Commodore 64 Basic". I'm hoping to finish the book by late summer 2026.

The program includes the following concepts: arrays, sound, color, and
getting input from keyboard.

If you want to make changes, you can easily save your updated version
by executing:

run 1

Changes you can make:
1. There is a gap between lines 45 and 97. You can add an intro screen
with music there.
2. You can also add a high score that gets saved to a file and gets loaded 
when the game starts. You can display the high score on the top right.
3. You can add a difficulty to allow the user to change the speed that the 
pattern plays. If you save high scores, you can have high scores for each
level of difficulty.
